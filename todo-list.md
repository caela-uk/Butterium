# To-Do list for Butterium development 📒

- [ ] Simple and temporary Python Butterium launcher and installer
> ↳  It's being developed by **me**, Claude and Gemini lmfao

- [ ] Better/nicer fast leaves RP built-in

- [ ] Hook in with Blossom Events
> ↳  PvP practise gamemode too or something

- [ ] Kill counter
> ↳  Maybe similar to Fortnite- skull icon?

- [ ] Move text to localization keys
> ↳  This would allow for translations of buttons and text

- [ ] Custom HUD item counters
> ↳  e.g. gapples, arrows, potions

- [ ] Recreate Appleskin in SpiffyHUD
> ↳  Kek said something in the FancyMenu Repo about this

- [x] Port to 1.21.1 Fabric
> ↳  I can't port to NeoForge yet, sorry

- [ ] [`ButterCord > #💡︱feature-requests`](https://discord.com/channels/1388641212977909881/1442602031935127673/1442622042854653982)

- [ ] HEX code accent colours
> ↳  https://github.com/Keksuccino/FancyMenu/issues/1398

- [ ] Allow compatible mods to be installed from in-game
> ↳  "You have unsaved changes" text for when the user needs to restart their game

>    Inspired by Lunar and Feather mods screens- showing just icons, clicking them opens the description and/or config (maybe a description screen with a button for config)

- [ ] Test auto-update and updating mods
> ↳  https://discord.com/channels/704163135787106365/1429870103545118840

> With "downloading update" and "your game may freeze during install, don't worry" texts

- [ ] Update and enable friends sidebar
> ↳  The friends sidebar is half-finished but the API is there and enabled/working

- [ ] Switch to .webp for backgrounds and more
> ↳  Not possible YET, request in FancyMenu GitHub

- [ ] Specs and help screen
> ↳  Similar to the old Astro/ButterSmooth one

- [ ] Credits screen with Butterium settings

- [ ] Open screen effects GIF (maybe at the mouse cursor)

- [ ] Space background with intense reverse parallax effect

- [ ] Donate and Discord buttons in options

- [ ] Fix variable names and values
> ↳  This will help users better understand Butterium and edit the FM configuration

- [ ] Known mod incompatibility warning from GitHub (ver).txt
> ↳  Compare loaded mods to a GitHub list of incompatible mods

- [ ] Known mod incompatibilities should be logged
> ↳  In the Minecraft logs using FMs new action

- [ ] Custom inventory shortcuts
> ↳  Should be styled like the inventory and also adapt to resource packs, maybe contact some RP creators to add support

- [ ] Remove some layouts for settings menus
> ↳  Would improve mod compatability with mods that change settings

- [ ] Send specs to API on command using MC username
> ↳  Optionally also logs but we must ask for the users explicit permission and warn them of what logs store before doing anything

- [ ] Advanced customisation button in personalisation and Credits menus that leads to new menu
> ↳  This menu should allow for the changing of asset locations and teach users how to create resource packs too

- [ ] Custom background replacing "0" in the BG carousel

- [ ] Move Butterium assets to a resource pack
> ↳  Would allow for resource packs to change Butterium assets

- [ ] Light and Midnight UI themes
> ↳  credit: fishandchips

- [ ] Replace button labels and text with localisation keys
> ↳  Would allow for multiple languages to be supported and for labels to change with resource packs

- [ ] Animated background (GIF, MP4 and MOV support)
> ↳  Likely to be used for user-added custom backgrounds

- [ ] Use the accent colour in more places and improve UI design
> ↳  Follow where OreUI would normally put its default green accent colour

- [ ] Tools for resource pack creators
> ↳  With new FancyMenu v3.8.0 actions - imagine making a resource pack just by walking around your world and clicking blocks to change their texture by selecting a png from your system. This will update the pack you're working on in real time but won't **replace** messing with files

- [ ] Toggleable health indicators
> ↳  Could be done with a resource pack or mod
